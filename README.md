  "Virtual Personal Finance Management Workshops Platform" might work, let's consider the functionality of managing users and personal finance resources. Here's a simplified walkthrough:

User Management:
Registration: Users can register on the platform by providing their username, email, password, first name, last name, and role (e.g., User, Instructor, Admin).

Login: Registered users can log in to the platform using their username and password.

Admin Dashboard: Administrators can access a dashboard where they can manage users. This includes viewing, adding, editing, and deleting user accounts. The dashboard provides functionalities like viewing user details, updating user information, and removing user accounts if necessary.

Personal Finance Resources Management:
Adding Resources: Administrators can add personal finance resources to the platform. These resources might include articles, videos, documents, or links to external resources. Each resource has a title, description, and link.

Viewing Resources: Users can view the list of available personal finance resources. They can click on a resource to access its details or follow the link provided to access external resources.

Editing and Deleting Resources: Administrators can edit or delete existing personal finance resources. This allows them to keep the platform updated with relevant and accurate information.

Example Interaction Flow:

User "John" registers on the platform as a regular user.
The registration form collects John's username, email, password, first name, last name, and assigns him the role of a User.
Admin Dashboard:
